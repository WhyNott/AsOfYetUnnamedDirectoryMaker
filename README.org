* HiveSheet

HiveSheet is a collaborative directory creation tool which allows for distributed gathering and verification of data. HiveSheet allows for easy creation of directory websites based on a Google Sheet, while allowing users to submit corrections, which are then automatically propagated back to the original sheet. These corrections can take the form of altering data or adding or removing entries. The validity of these changes is guarded by a robust hierarchical moderation system where certain portions of the directory (specified by arbitrary filtering criteria) can be assigned to require an additional moderator queue. The moderators can in turn delegate a portion of their portion to subordinate moderators, allowing for a flexible moderation system that can suit an organization structure or a distributed community.
